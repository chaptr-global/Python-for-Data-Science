# Python-for-Data-Science
Cheatsheets on Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Python Libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning
In this repository, we have availed summary cheatsheets on Python libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning. This is meant for anyone who wnat a quick tutorial on these libraries or anyone looking refresh memory or as a shorter reference point than the official documentation. Here are the libraries covered/to-be-covered in this repository:

1. NumPy (Scientific Computation)
2. Pandas (Tabular Data Manipulation and Analysis)
3. Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
4. Seaborn (Data Visualization)


### Additional Resources
We have also appended/will append resource essential for anyone learning these libraries and their applications. Here are the additional resources:

- Exploratory Data Analysis Cheatsheet (EDA) â€“ How to explore, prepare, and visualize data using these python libraries
- Practice Exercises on Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and EDA
- Sample Datasets to further practice of these libraries and EDA with real-world data
